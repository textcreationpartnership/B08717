         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:191826:13"/> Laws and Statutes which make mention thereof, and paying to my Royal Treaſury the Duties or Cuſtoms which ought to be paid, prohibiting, as I do prohibit and command, not to take from you by force any Merchandiſes, Wheat, or Barley, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be for the making ready or furniſhing my Armies, Fleets, or Gallions, nor for Purveyors or Stewards; and the Priviledges are to be concerning the Wheat and Barley accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Tun; and concerning the other things and Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſes, as you ſhall conclude and agree: but they may not take them out of your poſſeſſion until they have paid for them, unleſs for the ſame there be leave given, that they do not moleſt and trouble you. And foraſmuch as many of you do treat to bring into the Ports of <hi>Andaluſia,</hi> the City of <hi>Sivil,</hi> and other places, great quantity of <hi>Newfoundland fiſh,</hi> and other ſorts of dry and ſalted Fiſh, becauſe they are Victuals which are very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; and that you have been and are put to great Charges, and are much troubled, I do will and command to be kept the Ordinance of the City of <hi>Sivil,</hi> whereby it is ordained, that thoſe which come in with dry or ſalted Fiſh, there ſhall not be any Price or Rate ſet upon them, but they ſhall be permitted to ſell at ſuch a Price as they ſhall think good; and it ſhall not be neceſſary to manifeſt them any more then unto my Officers which receive my Royal Rents: and if the Ships wherein the ſaid Fiſh is brought be great Ships, that they cannot go up the River, and that the ſame be put into Barques or Lighters, the Judge of the Admiralty nor any other perſon may not put any Waiters or Keepers into the Barques or Lighters at the charge of the Owners of them.</p>
                  <p>And I do alſo command, That if the ſaid Fiſh ſhall appear to be rotten, and that it cannot be ſpent, that it be burnt, or thrown into the Sea; and that for this cauſe there ſhall not be any Cauſe or Action commenced againſt the Owners thererof, or perſons which ſhall ſell it, nor they ſhall not be impriſoned, nor informed againſt: And foraſmuch as the Adminiſters of the Cuſtoms, and others of divers duties which are received for the Fruits and Merchandiſes, do uſe when any body doth inform, to have the perſon impriſoned which ſheweth himſelf to be party, whereby happeneth to men of Trade great diſcredit,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:191826:14"/> charges, and vexations; My Will is, and I do command, that in the ſaid Information there ſhall be only proceeded againſt the Merchandiſes, and not againſt the perſons; but they ſhall be permitted (as I do permit them) to make, and they ſhall make their defences in the ſaid Vexation. And foraſmuch alſo, as according to an Article of the ſaid Peace, which maketh menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Matters in Religion, notwithſtanding that in ſome Suits they ſhould declare whether they be Roman Catholicks or not, excuſing themſelves to give faith to others which they take as parties or as witneſſes;</p>
                  <p>I do alſo command, That concerning this matter there be not done, nor there ſhall not be done, any thing with thoſe which are born in the ſaid Realm, but only that the ſaid Condition be kept and accompliſhed, and that no ſuch queſtions be put unto them giving unto the Oaths which they ſhall take in Judgement Court, and without, the ſame faith and credit which ſhould be given in caſe they were <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and herein you ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any trouble or moleſtation, nor there ſhall not be any grievance done unto you: And whereas for the Juſtification of ſome cauſes, the Judges and Juſtices do pretend that the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of the ſaid Nation ſhould exhibite Books of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions or dealings; I do will and command, that the Books of the Merchants of the ſaid Nation ſhall not be taken out of their hands for any cauſe whatſoever, but they ſhall keep and ſhew them in their houſes, to take out the parcel which ſhall be appointed, and others ſhall not be demanded of them, nor there ſhall not be any other Papers taken from them, upon penalty that he which ſhall do here againſt, ſhall be puniſhed according to Law.</p>
                  <p>And foraſmuch as the Merchants do diſpatch the Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe from the Cuſtom-houſe of the ſaid City of <hi>Sivil</hi> of all Duties, and becauſe there are many which do make up a ſheet, which is Subſcribed and Signed by all the Officers, and remaineth in the hand of the <hi>Alcayde</hi> of the Cuſtom-houſe; for that by vertue thereof, the Merchandiſes are permitted to go forth, which are in Fardels, Packs, Trunks and Caſes; and afterwards when they have taken them forth, and put them into their Houſes and Warehouſes, the chief Keeper of the Cuſtom-houſe,
